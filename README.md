# DESIGNING A RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM BASED ON PURCHASE DATA
### Description
This project was done as a part of Hackathon 2 conducted by Univ.ai.
I build a recommendation system based on purchase data of users being shared in the form of a dataset. I used
methods like Matrix Factorization, Collaborative filtering etc. to build a Recommendation system.

### Dataset
Dataset is provided by the Hackathon organiser Univ.ai. Dataset contains past - purchase data of users.
The Datasets can be downloaded from https://hack.univ.ai/problem/data

Training Data:
This file contains the detailed purchasing history for every user. It has order value and the category of the product.

Training Data Target:
This file contains data for some users about the category of items they bought in future.

Test Data:
This file contains the detailed purchasing history for some users. It has the order value and the category of the product. You have to predict the top 3 categories that the users with these user_ids will purchase from in the future.

### Goal of the Project / Problem statement of the Hackathon
For each user, predict the top 3 probable product categories that they may purchase from, in the future.
